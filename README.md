# BangBangtan Web Design Project
Intro to Web Design Final (2022)

## Overview
This project was completed as part of an introductory web design course, where we explored the fundamental tools and concepts of web development. The objective was to create a basic webpage using HTML and experiment with different web design applications.

## Deliverables
The project was initially hosted on a custom domain for demonstration purposes. However, since it was a class project and required a paid subscription, the domain has since expired. The website can still be viewed locally by opening the files from the zip folder above in a browser.
